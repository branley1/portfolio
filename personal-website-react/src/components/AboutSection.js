      <h2>Who Am I?</h2>
      <p>
        I am a rising sophomore at Swarthmore College, and I just started to look for CS internship roles for Summer 2023. 
        As a Computer Science major and Cognitive Science minor, my interests are broadly in Artificial Intelligence and Computational Linguistics.
        <br /><br />
        I intend to use natural language processing to identify knowledge implicit in large collections of text and apply this knowledge to build innovative applications.
        This way, I want to finesse human-computer interactions and create a proper understanding between machines and humans.
